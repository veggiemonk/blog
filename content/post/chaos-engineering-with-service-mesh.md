I've been trying out [Istio](https://istio.io/) for a while now in order to fully grasp what is a service mesh
and how to set it up. I made a presentation for the [local CNCF meetup in Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Computing-Stockholm/events/251231228/) where I live.

The demo took the most time to prepare and there was a lot of material to cover but it got me going.
Hopefully, I can record the presentation and put it online.

Stay tuned!
