This is the feedback that I sent to someone who is trying to make it in the open source world.
Today is Sunday, I don't have a lot of free time, so here it is:

---
Since I know how hard it is to thrive in open source, please allow me to be brutally honest in the feedback.
I might use strong words but it's because I try to make you understand how to succeed in your project.

I would recommend this article: https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/single-post/2019/02/17/7-Common-Content-Marketing-Mistakes-Developers-Make-and-How-to-Avoid-Them

It takes too much time for me to figure out what is that project, what are its dependencies, how to install it and how to use it. 
Those sections should be part of the README or website. 
Then a use case section would be nice. What is the problem that the software solves.
If the project can't answer that in the first 30 seconds, it will drown in the continuous flood of new projects I see popup every day/hour/second .... I just don't have the time to figure things out and "play" with them. 

Apparently, it seems to be a "file sharing platform".
Personally I don't care about file sharing platforms since I don't share files! 
I share pictures, code repo, video, links, articles, tweet, screenshots, and so on....
I use different services for each, if that platform can centralised everything, I might have a look at it. 
Otherwise, I'm better off without yet another thing in my life.

Go straight to the point of what problem does it solves, please have a look at this 
video on youtube: ["20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes by Dave Wascha"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69U0lvi89c)

I hope this helps,


Julien
